##GitHub User Search

Hi! This is a little piece of code that makes use of the [GitHub Search API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/search#search-users "GitHub Search API") and focusses on user search. Search users by any parameter, i.e. profile name, and jump right into their GitHub profile.

### Use

- Get a GH personal access token from your accounts' developer settings to be used as a bearer token for authentification with the API
- Clone the repo
- `npm install`
- Duplicate .`env.local.example`, rename into `.env.local` and place your access token here
- Done!
